	<h1> It's all about penguins. </h1>
	<h2> Here's why. </h2>
	
	<p> <li> <ul> Penguins' black and white plumage serves as camouflage while swimming. The black plumage on their back is hard to see from above, while the white plumage on their front looks like the sun reflecting off the surface of the water when seen from below. </ul>
		<li><ul> Fossils place the earliest penguin relative at some 60 million years ago, meaning an ancestor of the birds we see today survived the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. </ul>

		<li><ul>Penguins ingest a lot of seawater while hunting for fish, but a special gland behind their eyes, the supraorbital gland-filters out the saltwater from their blood stream. Penguins excrete it through their beaks, or by sneezing.</ul>
		<li><ul>Unlike most birds, which lose and replace a few feathers at a time; penguins molt all at once, spending two or three weeks land-bound as they undergo what is called the catastrophic molt.</ul>
